# Adversarial image detection based on Bayesian Neural Network Layers (Experimental Code)
Experimental Code

Hi, This is the code repository to apply some experiments in the adversarial image generation. The code use the mnist dataset to create adversarial images in the first to categories of this DS. You will find the models folder and the MNF folder to the generation of Bayesian NN in this investigation.

If you have question obut this work, please send us to davilam@unbosque.edu.co
